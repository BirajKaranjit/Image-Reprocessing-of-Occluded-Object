# Image-Reprocessing-of-Occluded-Object
This project work is done as the Minor project of the Campus. 
Image reprocessing of occluded object is the project related to the filed of image processing and computer vision. 
The presence of occlusions in images often hampers their interpretability and utility in var-
ious applications. In this project, we aim to address the challenge of image reprocessing for
occluded images using deep learning inpainting techniques. Our work focuses on employing
neural networks specifically designed for inpainting tasks to restore and enhance the clarity
of occluded images
